          Welcome to the ESP32 IoT project repository! This project combines the
          power of ESP32 microcontrollers, Proteus simulation, Arduino
          programming, Git version control, Postman for API testing, and
          DigitalOcean for cloud deployment. This was all done and made during
          the DA Hacks 2023 Hackathon from 10/20/2023 to 10/21/2023.
