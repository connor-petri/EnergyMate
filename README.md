## Requirements

Make sure you have the following tools and technology installed:

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- [Proteus](https://www.labcenter.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- [DigitalOcean Account](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
- [ThingSpeak API](https://thingspeak.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   [git clone https://github.com/your-username/esp32-iot-project.git](https://github.com/connor-petri/EnergyMate)
   ```

2. Set up Arduino IDE for ESP32 development.

3. Install required Python packages:


4. Set up MySQL database and configure SQLAlchemy connection.

## Goals 

### Short-term Goal
Our immediate mission is to raise awareness about the financial implications tied to their electronic appliances, empowering them with the knowledge and tools needed to not only conserve electricity but also safeguard their financial resources. By shedding light on energy consumption and its financial impact, we aim to cultivate a culture of responsible energy use, ensuring a bright future for all.

### Long-Term Goal
Our overarching, long-term aspiration is to play a pivotal role in the global fight against climate change by offering an innovative and efficient solution for conserving electricity. In doing so, we aim to contribute to the preservation of our planet's precious resources, fostering sustainability and environmental well-being for future generations.

## Usage

1. Open the Arduino IDE and upload the provided ESP32 code to your microcontroller.

2. Simulate the project in Proteus to visualize the hardware interactions.

3. Connect to the ThingSpeak API, use it to visualize and graph our data and status of our microcontroller, alongside storing our actual data.
4. Use Postman to test the API endpoints.

5. Deploy the project to DigitalOcean for cloud-based IoT solutions.
